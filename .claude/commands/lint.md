Please run `make  lint` and fix ALL lints no matter whether you consider them in your current scope or not.
Do not take any shortcuts like marking lints as invalid just because it is a lot of work to fix them.
You may explicitly ask the user for confirmation if you really think it is not feasible to fix a lint.
