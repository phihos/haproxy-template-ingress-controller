## Dependencies

The implementation requires:
- `k8s.io/client-go/tools/leaderelection` (already in go.mod)
- `k8s.io/api/coordination/v1` (for Lease resources, already in go.mod)

No new external dependencies needed.

## Testing Plan

### Manual Testing Steps

1. Deploy with single replica (leader election disabled):
   ```yaml
   controller:
     leader_election:
       enabled: false
   replicas: 1
   ```
   Verify: Controller works as before

2. Deploy with multiple replicas (leader election enabled):
   ```yaml
   controller:
     leader_election:
       enabled: true
   replicas: 3
   ```
   Verify: Only one replica deploys configs

3. Kill leader pod:
   ```bash
   kubectl delete pod <leader-pod>
   ```
   Verify: Follower becomes leader within 20 seconds

4. Check lease status:
   ```bash
   kubectl get lease -n <namespace> haproxy-template-ic-leader -o yaml
   ```
   Verify: Holder identity matches current leader

5. Check metrics:
   ```bash
   kubectl port-forward deployment/haproxy-template-ic 9090:9090
   curl http://localhost:9090/metrics | grep controller_is_leader
   ```
   Verify: Only one pod reports is_leader=1

### Integration Test Plan

Run integration tests with kind cluster:
```bash
# Start test cluster with 3 controller replicas
make test-integration-leader-election

# Verify tests pass:
# - Only leader deploys
# - Failover works
# - All replicas watch resources
```

## Rollout Strategy

### Phase 1: Opt-in (v0.2.0)
- Release with `enabled: false` default
- Document how to enable for HA
- Collect feedback from early adopters
- Monitor for issues

### Phase 2: Enabled by Default (v0.3.0)
- Change default to `enabled: true`
- Update documentation
- Provide migration guide for single-replica users

### Phase 3: Deprecate Single Replica (v1.0.0)
- Remove `enabled` flag
- Always use leader election
- Multi-replica is standard deployment

## Known Limitations

1. **Lease expiry time**: ~15-20 second downtime during failover
2. **Clock skew sensitivity**: Requires synchronized node clocks
3. **Split-brain prevention**: Relies on Kubernetes API availability
4. **No priority-based selection**: Random selection among followers

## Next Steps

1. Complete controller startup integration (Task #5)
2. Add metrics (Task #6)
3. Update commentator (Task #7)
4. Update RBAC and deployment manifests (Tasks #8-9)
5. Write tests (Tasks #10-11)
6. Update documentation (Task #12)
7. Manual testing with kind cluster
8. Code review and refinement
9. Release v0.2.0 with opt-in HA support

## Implementation Summary

### What Was Completed

**Core Infrastructure** (100% complete):
- Leader election package with Config, LeaderElector, comprehensive validation
- Event types for all leadership transitions
- Configuration schema with YAML support and defaults
- Full controller integration with conditional component startup
- Mutex-protected lifecycle management for thread-safe transitions

**Observability** (100% complete):
- 3 new Prometheus metrics (leader status, transitions, time as leader)
- Automatic time tracking with event-driven updates
- Rich contextual logging with emojis for visibility
- All leader election events integrated into commentator

**Deployment** (100% complete):
- RBAC permissions for Lease resources
- POD_NAME/POD_NAMESPACE via downward API
- Helm chart configured with sensible defaults
- Default replica count set to 2 for HA

**Testing** (Unit tests complete, integration tests pending):
- 9 comprehensive unit tests covering all scenarios
- Config validation, disabled mode, state tracking, events
- All tests passing

### Architecture Highlights

- **Component Separation**: Leader-only components (Deployer, DeploymentScheduler, DriftMonitor) vs all-replica components (Reconciler, Renderer, Validator, Executor, Discovery)
- **Disabled Mode**: Backward compatible single-replica mode with consistent code paths
- **Graceful Failover**: ~15-20 second downtime during leadership transitions
- **Lease-based**: Using coordination.k8s.io/v1 Lease resources for lower overhead

### Next Steps

1. Write integration tests (Task #11)
2. Update documentation (Task #12)
3. Manual testing with kind cluster
4. Code review and refinement
5. Release with HA support

## Questions for Review

- ‚úÖ Should leader election be enabled by default in first release? **YES - Now enabled by default with 2 replicas**
- Should we add health check endpoint showing leadership status? **Consider for future**
- Do we need metrics for lease renewal failures? **client-go handles this internally, current metrics sufficient**
- Should we add alerts for frequent leadership transitions? **Yes - document in operations guide**
